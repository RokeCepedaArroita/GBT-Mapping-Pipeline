# Produce map of lambda_orionis_ame_13.7GHz_1deg.fits and lambda_orionis_ame_4.85GHz_1deg.fits using commander code, use 6.5 deg cut (tomorrow can produce x-band, don't worry for now)

# Match 1 deg Planck 857 GHz map to the AME maps to get factors

# Produce AME at 13.7 model at 1 deg scales: ame_model_13.7GHz.fits



# Produce AME at 4.85 model at 1 deg scales: ame_model_4.85GHz.fits


# Plot the 1 deg versions against QUIJOTE 13 and c-bass as a sanity check 



# Take H-alpha map without corrections, and apply conversion factor


# Produce free-free at 13.7 GHz model at finest scale


# Produce free-free at 4.85 GHz model at finest scales
